[English]
When writing academic thesis, some journals define the format of references by themselves. The format of references provided by CNKI(知网) is incomplete or not supported, and manual adjustment is troublesome. Therefore, I am going to write an automatic tool, Reference-Converter, to cover this requirement.

**Now, the preliminary functions include:**

 - [ ] analyzing common reference formats
 - [ ] bidirectional conversion among these common reference  formats
 - [ ] support user to define their unique reference formats and convert rules
 - [ ] support user to convert common reference formats to their defined reference formats

**Platform:**

 - [ ] Win64 (In the schedule)
 - [ ] Linux (May be in the future)
